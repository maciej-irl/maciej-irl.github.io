## CEO and co-founder of Google.

## Who is he? (And what's up with the name?)

He and Sergey Brin founded Google as a research project for a PhD in Stanford university. Originally named "BackRub" it was later renamed to "Google" as a twist on word "Googol", 1 followed by 100 zeros (10<sup>100</sup>).

## Early life.

He was born in East Lansing, Michigan, United States. His father had a PhD in Computer Science and was considered a "pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence.". His mother was Gloria Page.

He attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. He holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University.

During his childhood he was fascinated with technology. His early life achievements include being the first kid in school to return an assignment in a word processor. He once said during an interview that his room was always a mess full of computers and Popular Science magazines. After his brother thought him how to take things apart and before long he was "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". 

## BackRub - A PhD project

BackRun precursor of Google started with Page's fascination of mathematical properties of the World Wide Web. He thought about representing the internet as a graph. Websites that were linked to by other important websites were ranked higher. He named the algorithm PageRank. His supervisor Terry Winograd encouraged him to pursue this idea, which Page later recalled as the best advice he ever got. Afterward Sergy Brin (now co-founder of Google) joined the project.

## How Larry met Brin

They originally met in March of 1995. Larry was told to show new students around the campus and met Brin in the process. They quickly became friends.
