The negative image of William Martin Murphy that we know today ordinated because he didn't support trade unions organised by Jim Larkin.

This made him extremely unpopular with many, being depicted as a vulture or a vampire in the workers' press.

## Conclusion

William Martin Murphy was an interesting man. He is a great example how each story can have two sides and how easily history can be biased.

This is the main reason I picked him.
